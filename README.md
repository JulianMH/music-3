# music³

music³ is a fast and elegant music player for windows phone.

I do no longer have time to update and keep developing this app, but I will update it in the store if someone contributes to this project on github.

## Contributing

If you want to add features, feel to do so and submit a pull request. Or you just fork it and build your own music player app.

No Idea where to start? Here are some things that could to be done:

- windows 10 compatibility (ideally as an universal app)
- exporting and importing playlists
- better tools to edit playlists
- tools to edit song metadata
- translate comments in the code which are still in german to english
-
